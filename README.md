## Key Concepts & Architecture

### Financial Assistant:
- The assistant asks about your financial state, suggests how to invest, teaches you about the stock market, and provides investment ideas based on data retrieved from the RAG Agent, making use of our fine-tuned LLMs for better accuracy and decision-making.

### Autonomous Transaction System (RAG Agent):
- Using the RAG agent, the assistant can automatically perform transactions (buy, sell) in the stock market on behalf of the user, all while ensuring that the transactions are secure via blockchain technology.

### Blockchain Integration:
- Vestern integrates blockchain for secure transaction processing. It provides an added layer of security and transparency while handling financial transactions.

### Anonymous Aadhar Concept:
- For enhanced security, the app includes anonymous Aadhar integration, ensuring that users' sensitive data remains safe.

### Predictive Models:
- The system utilizes machine learning models to predict stock trends, suggest investments, and analyze past data to optimize portfolio management.
